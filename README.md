# Satisfaction Permutation Tests

In class we discussed analysis of an employee satisfaction survey. Since the survey was a census, 
normal statistical approaches (like a t-test) do not apply. This assignment asks you to 
extend the work with a few more tests. The R-Markdown file has code blocks for you to edit and 
questions for you to answer. 

When you submit your work, make sure to "knit" your RMD to an `.html` file and include that file in the repo you submit. (You can also knit to PDF and Word formats, which are great, but the HTML files are a bit easier for me to evaluate.)
